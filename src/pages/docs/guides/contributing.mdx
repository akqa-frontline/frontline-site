## Docs
Frontline Docs are written in MDX that lets you write JSX in Markdown documents.
This can make the documents more engaging and easier for the reader to understand.

You import a component and use it like you would in React.

```mdx
import { Demo } from '@/components/playground/Demo'

<Demo />
```

This will result in

import { Demo } from '@/components/playground/Demo'

<Demo />

<br /><br />
