title: 'Single Page Application (SPA)'
layout: 'docs'

The idea of single page application (SPA) is to load all frontend resources once to avoid reloading the same layout on each page.
Clicking on internal links only rewrites the existing page.
Decoupling the frontend and the backend so only data is transferred back and forth.

Improve performance with [lazy loading](/docs/development/lazy-loading).

In short, it is the Frontline version of create-react-app.
