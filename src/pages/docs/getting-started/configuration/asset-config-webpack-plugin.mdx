Static assets configuration for webpack.

## What does it do
This package does not do much currently.

When creating a production build, it will copy all files except HTML files from the public folder to the build output folder.

## Install
Install this package and its peer dependencies:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @akqa-frontline/asset-config-webpack-plugin
npm install --save-dev --save-exact webpack
```

## Usage
Add the plugin to your webpack configuration

```javascript
// webpack.config.js

const {FrontlineAssetConfigWebpackPlugin} = require("@akqa-frontline/asset-config-webpack-plugin")

module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        new FrontlineAssetConfigWebpackPlugin()
    ]
}
```

Take a look at [webpack-config](/getting-started/configuration/webpack-config) for instructions on a more complete Frontline webpack configuration.
