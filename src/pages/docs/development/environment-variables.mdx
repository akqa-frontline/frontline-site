## Examples

The env variables in your `.env` file can be used directly in your HTML.
This is great for things such as Google Analytics!

- `FRONTLINE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`
- `FRONTLINE_API_KEY`
- `FRONTLINE_FEATURE_TOGGLE`

## Usage

To define and use your own env variables, follow these steps:
1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project
2. Write your env variables, they ***must*** be prefixed with `FRONTLINE` - example:
```javascript
FRONTLINE_API_KEY=apisftw
```
3. Access it:
```javascript
process.env.FRONTLINE_API_KEY
```

## Built-in variables

- `NODE_ENV`: `"development" | "production"`
- `PUBLIC_URL`

There are also two built-in env variables, the `NODE_ENV` and the `PUBLIC_URL`
Use `NODE_ENV` to help determine if you are running production code or not.
Use `PUBLIC_URL` as a prefix for assets hosted in the public folder, always.

Asset HTML example:
```html
  <img src="%PUBLIC_URL%/images/dog.webp" />
```
