The following tools will help you maintain good code quality with formatting and linting.


## ESlint
https://eslint.org/
`.eslintrc.js`

See package

## stylelint
https://stylelint.io/
`.stylelintrc.js`

See package

## Prettier
https://prettier.io/
`.prettier.config.js`

## EditorConfig
The [`.editorconfig`](https://editorconfig.org/) file at the root of the project helps maintain consistent coding style across machines and editors.

Some editors require you to download a plugin. Check if your editor is one of them https://editorconfig.org/#download

## husky and lint-staged
Use [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) to improve commits and keep them consistent with the rules of the project.
It allows you to fire custom scripts when specific actions occur in the git process.

Below is an example where ESlint, stylelint and Prettier checks for issues and autofixes if possible.
[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) ensures that linters are only run against staged files.

```
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx}": "eslint --cache --fix --max-warnings 0",
    "*.{css,scss}": "stylelint --fix --max-warnings 0",
    "*.{js,jsx,css,scss,md,mdx,json}": "prettier --write"
  }
```
