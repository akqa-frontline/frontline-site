Use `React.lazy` to dynamically import a component.
Dynamic imports are a way of code-splitting so you don't request components until they are needed.

## Lazy loaded default import
```jsx
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
```

## Lazy loaded named import
There seems to be this workaround:
```jsx
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(
  () => import('./OtherComponent').then(module => ({ default: module.OtherComponent }))
);
```

But the React-safe way forces you to re-export a named export as the default export.
```jsx
export { OtherComponent as default } from "./OtherComponent";
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(
  () => import('./OtherComponent').then(module => ({ default: module.OtherComponent }))
);
```

## Suspense
The lazy loaded component should be rendered inside a `Suspense` component.
The `Suspense` component allows you to display a loader until the component is ready.

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <OtherComponent />
</Suspense>
```
## Error Boundaries
If a component encounters an error or fails to load it will throw an error.
An `Error Boundary` is able catch errors inside that boundary while the rest of the site is fully functional.

The easiest way to get stated is by using the package `react-error-boundary`.

```
npm install --save react-error-boundary
```

Install it and follow [their guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary#usage) on how to use it.
