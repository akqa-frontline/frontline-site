[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) helps you build UI components in isolation.
A button usually have different states such as regular, disabled or loading.
Those states can be hard to find in the real app.
With Storybook you can build stories for each component and its states.
Then Storybook becomes a collection of all your generic components which is easy to show to new developers.
