If you want to use the good old vanilla Javascript this is how you get started.

1. Get the [starter bundle](/docs/getting-started/flavours/spa)
2. Go to `main.js` and change `reactBootstrapper` to `bootstrapper` or `asyncBootstrapper`.
The latter splits the code into smaller parts
3. Delete App.jsx and the example component
4. Feel free to delete everything related to React in `package.json`
