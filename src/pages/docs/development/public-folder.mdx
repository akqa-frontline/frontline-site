Files in the public folder are copied to the build folder untouched.

## Reference assets
Import assets in Javascript.
```
import logo from './logo.png';
```

Use the [environment variable](/docs/development/environment-variables) `PUBLIC_URL` to reference assets in HTML.
```html
<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
```


## Copy files on build
You can copy files to the public and make them accessible from the root of the page with the package `copy-webpack-plugin`

```js
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

// webpack.config.js
sharedPlugins: [
  ...
  new CopyPlugin([{ from: "./src/environment/environment.runtime.json", to: "environment.runtime.json" }]),
  new CopyPlugin([{ from: "./src/translations/da-DK.json", to: "api/v1/translations/da-DK", toType: "file" }]),
]
```
